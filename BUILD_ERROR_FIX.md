# Next.js Build Error Fix

## Issue

During the build process, the following error occurred:

```
Error: ENOENT: no such file or directory, open 'C:\Projects\Backend\cms-backend\.next\routes-manifest.json'
Error occurred prerendering page "/api/graphql-playground". Read more: https://nextjs.org/docs/messages/prerender-error

Error: Cannot find module './4892.js'
Require stack:
- C:\Projects\Backend\cms-backend\.next\server\webpack-runtime.js
- C:\Projects\Backend\cms-backend\.next\server\app\(payload)\api\graphql-playground\route.js
```

## Root Cause

The error was caused by a corrupted or incomplete build. The `.next` directory contained incomplete build artifacts, specifically missing the `routes-manifest.json` file and some JavaScript modules required by the GraphQL playground route.

## Solution

The issue was resolved by:

1. Stopping the development server
2. Running a clean build with `pnpm run build`
3. Restarting the development server with `pnpm dev`

This process regenerated all necessary build artifacts, including the missing `routes-manifest.json` file and required JavaScript modules.

## Prevention

To prevent similar issues in the future:

1. Ensure that builds complete successfully before starting the development server
2. If you encounter similar errors, try cleaning the `.next` directory and rebuilding
3. Make sure all dependencies are correctly installed and compatible
4. Check for any file system permission issues that might prevent proper file creation
